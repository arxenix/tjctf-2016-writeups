## Problem
The History Museum sent us some money and encrypted the transfer using an Enigma Machine. Unfortunately, we were unable to decrypt the cipher and retrieve the money. Can you help us out? This is all we have.

## Solution
We started by reading about how engima machines worked online. From a ticket, we learned that this enigma machine did not utilize a pegboard (*steckers*). We also knew that the answer was not surrounded by the normal `tjctf{}` marker.
