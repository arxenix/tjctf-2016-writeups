## Problem
Sometimes, I miss that land of bliss.
Outbox.zip

---

## Solution
TODO - waiting for them to re-upload the file so I can do a better writeup... From what I remember, first was some sort of mail inbox archive. Opened it up in a program and there was 1 email with an attachment. Used some other tool to extract that attachment, and the flag was hidden somewhere in there.
