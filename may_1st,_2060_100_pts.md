## Problem
Sometimes, I miss that land of bliss.
Outbox.zip

---

## Solution
We are given a file, Outbox.zip. We unzip this, and see a `.dbx` file named `Outbox.dbx`. We found that `.dbx` files were some sort of email mailbox archive file. We used a free program: http://www.mitec.cz/mailview.html, to view its contents, and found an email with an attachment, `Backup.bkf`. We used another program to extract the .bfk file (forget name), and found 2 `flag.doc` files inside a `ctf` folder. In the bigger `flag.doc` file, one of the images had the flag in it.
