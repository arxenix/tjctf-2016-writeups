## Problem

---

## Solution
1) Write a z3 python script that takes in all the constraints. For example, we know that the string given to us is in format `tjctf{...}`, and that it's in ascii. As such, we already know the values of a lot of the characters:<br>
2) Get each letter value from the z3 model.<br>
3) Convert the flag numbers to ascii to get the flag.
